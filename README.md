An Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) network-based approach to link zebrafish transcriptomics-derived points of departure (PODt) with behavioral toxicity (PODa).

System Requirements
R
All code in this package has been tested on R 3.6.0 and 4.4.1, but any version of R 3.x or 4.x should be compatible. Other package versions may have impact the use of httrpathway due to changes in functionality, function parameter updates (e.g. GSVA), or changes in API.

This approach enables the benchmarking of concentration-responsive genes and biomolecular pathways, as well as the identification and visualization of AOP networks annotated by omics profiles.

An R package implementing this method is currently under development for public release.
