An Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) network-based approach to link zebrafish transcriptomics-derived points of departure (PODt) with behavioral toxicity (PODa).

This approach enables the benchmarking of concentration-responsive genes and biomolecular pathways, as well as the identification and visualization of AOP networks annotated by omics profiles.

An R package implementing this method is currently under development for public release.
